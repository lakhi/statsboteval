# Decision log

ADR-style, newest at the bottom. Record significant choices and reversals here.

## 2026-06-10 — founding session (planning round with Claude Code)

**D-01 · Separate repo.** StatsBotEval lives in its own repo, not inside the StatsBot repo.
The projects share *data, not code* — the only coupling is the shape of two MySQL tables,
documented in `source-data-dictionary.md`. Drivers: different publication destinies (thesis
code public/citable vs production university app), different people (co-authors don't need
prod-app access), different lifecycles (active thesis development vs maintenance mode),
tooling cleanliness, GDPR hygiene (clonable without the prod app). Accepted costs: extra
clone; manual data-dictionary sync on schema changes.

**D-02 · Repo scope = whole framework.** Milestone 1 (dashboard) and milestone 2 (ML
analysis) share this repo and the local data layer. Repo named `statsboteval`, matching the
abstract/thesis brand.

**D-03 · Weekly batch, not real time.** The abstract's "real time" is reinterpreted as a
weekly refresh — educators check week over week; bounded classification cost; no live
connection to defend.

**D-04 · Local corpus / cloud aggregates split.** Forced by the consent addendum
("password-protected local storage medium"): the pseudonymized corpus stays local; Azure
receives only privacy-floored aggregates. Supersedes the earlier in-session idea of an Azure
Postgres research DB. See `ethics/data-handling.md`.

**D-05 · Pseudonyms = HMAC(uid, secret pepper).** Stable across runs without a stored mapping
table; erasure = recompute + delete. Pepper custody to be fixed (open question).

**D-06 · Local corpus DB = Postgres in Docker.** Mirrors the health-research-agent-api
pattern (compose, lazy init); real SQL for aggregation; volume on the protected disk.

**D-07 · Versioned classification labels.** Import the team's labels as `bergmann-v1`; our
automated pipeline writes `statsboteval-v1`. Dashboard reads one configured version; overlap
doubles as a validation set. Classification is in milestone 1, phased: Phase A descriptive
dashboard first, Phase B classification pipeline.

**D-08 · Conversation = `started` session.** StatsBot's app-native grouping (one "new chat"
click). Derived sessionization can be added later for comparability with the Bergmann study's
student+time reconstruction.

**D-09 · Privacy floor from day one.** Every published aggregate suppresses cells covering
fewer than N students (working N = 5; confirm against ethics protocol) — applied locally at
aggregation time, making the public cloud side structurally non-identifying.

**D-10 · Publish path = file to Azure Blob.** The pipeline uploads one versioned aggregates
file; the API reads it. No cloud database; "refresh" = a new file version; history retained.

**D-11 · Stack = Angular SPA + FastAPI on Azure.** Follows the health-research-agent-api
deployment pattern (FastAPI, Docker, env switching). Matches existing skills (Angular daily in
StatsBot; FastAPI/Azure in health-research-agent-api) and produces a thesis-grade artifact.

**D-12 · No auth in the feedback phase.** Dashboard is public by URL to ease feedback —
acceptable because only privacy-floored aggregates exist cloud-side. Revisit before wide
circulation; auth designed to be added later.

**D-13 · Dashboard UI in English.** German can be added via Angular i18n if educators ask.

**D-14 · Docs in repo.** Abstract as Markdown + canonical PDF; consent addendum PDF + extracted
constraints; source data dictionary; Bergmann framework reference; this log; open questions.
The ZID presentation (3.9 MB ODP) is linked, not committed. No data files, ever.

**D-15 · Repo is public on GitHub.** Published at https://github.com/lakhi/statsboteval for
thesis reproducibility. The committed PDFs are public-facing documents already (the abstract
is a conference submission; the consent addendum is shown to every student at registration).
The no-data-in-git rule (D-14, `ethics/data-handling.md`) is what makes public visibility safe.

## 2026-06-12 — decision review session (full D-01…D-15 re-validation with Claude Code)

All founding decisions were re-examined with rationale. Twelve stand unchanged; the entries
below record the changes, plus two new facts that reshaped the plan: direct MySQL access to
the production DB exists, and milestone 1 build order was chosen.

**D-16 · Bergmann framework reference is local-only until their study is published.**
(Amends D-14/D-15.) `docs/bergmann-framework.md` distills the team's work-in-progress study
document and contains unpublished results (validation MCCs, rater scores, descriptives,
theme counts) — publishing them in a public repo before the team's paper was an oversight.
Removed from git history (`git filter-repo`, force-pushed 2026-06-12; repo had no forks),
kept locally, excluded via `.gitignore`. Restore to the repo after their publication.

**D-17 · Local corpus DB = DuckDB.** (Supersedes D-06.) The workload is single-writer,
weekly-batch, scan-and-aggregate — embedded OLAP territory, not client–server OLTP. DuckDB
makes the corpus one file on the FileVault-encrypted disk (the cleanest reading of the
consent's "password-protected local storage medium"), removes the Docker-daemon dependency
from every local run, and hands query results zero-copy to pandas for milestone 2. Plain
numbered `.sql` migrations replace alembic. D-06's "pattern reuse" rationale actually
belongs to the cloud deployment (FastAPI/Docker/Azure), which is unaffected — cloud-side
StatsBotEval has no database at all (D-10).

**D-18 · API-tier rationale corrected; aggregates blob is private.** (Amends D-11/D-10.)
The strongest reason for the FastAPI tier is not skill match but that it is the future
**auth boundary** (D-12 plans auth later; a static-SPA-reads-blob design would need the API
retrofitted then anyway) and the stable contract while the blob format evolves. Accordingly
the blob is kept private with the API reading via connection string — more restrictive than
D-10's public-by-URL allowance; only the dashboard URL is public.

**D-19 · Milestone 1 build order = walking skeleton.** Chosen over pipeline-first and
dashboard-first: define the aggregates contract, push one synthetic metric end-to-end
through pipeline → blob → API → SPA deployed on Azure early, then widen metric by metric.
Retires deployment/integration risk first and produces a demo URL for team feedback from
the start. Plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-12-milestone-1-phase-a.md`.

**D-20 · Weekly extract = scripted direct-MySQL pull with in-flight pseudonymization.**
(Refines D-03/D-05; resolves the export-capability open question.) A direct MySQL
connection to the production DB exists, so the extract is scripted: incremental by
`history.id` watermark, HMAC applied in-flight — raw identifiers flow from MySQL through
memory into the pseudonym and are never persisted locally. The corpus is therefore fully
reproducible from the source DB until the mid-2027 export deadline, which also lowers the
stakes on pepper rotation (worst case: re-ingest).

## 2026-06-19 — Bergmann materials review

**D-21 · Bergmann source-of-truth hierarchy.** (Refines D-16.) The team's work-in-progress
results manuscript is the canonical source for every Bergmann-derived fact in this repo; the
OSF Stage-1 registered-report PDFs are an earlier, superseded artifact (they predate the final
model, sample, and production-codebook decisions) and must not be relied on for those details.
The reconciliation, the verbatim coding prompts, and the canonical-source pointer all live in
the git-ignored local docs `bergmann-framework.md` and `bergmann-prompts.md` (kept local per
D-16). Two open handover items remain (message join key; bachelor/master mapping source); the
exact prompts and OSF review are now closed (`open-questions.md`).

## 2026-07-02 — Bergmann Stage-2 release review

**D-22 · Bergmann canon = the public Stage-2 OSF/Zenodo release.** (Supersedes D-21's
working-doc canon.) On 2026-06-30 the team published the PCI RR **Stage 2 Full Manuscript
(final)** and a complete "Stage 2 - R Code and Data" folder (coded dataset, final theme
lists, production inductive prompts, analysis scripts) at https://osf.io/v8ydk/, plus the
raw 1,400 chat messages on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20827020, open access).
The working Google Doc — the draft of this manuscript — is retired as a source. All local
Bergmann docs were re-reconciled against the release; corrections of record: 182 users (not
192), study window 2025-03-15→2025-06-30, bachelor onboarding 2025-05-16, delivered labels
are 300 human-consensus + 1,100 GPT-5 rows. The former handover items (coded dataset, join
key = `history.id`, theme lists) resolved themselves via the public release; the remaining
Bergmann asks are narrower (`open-questions.md`). **Flag for next decision review:** D-16
keeps `bergmann-framework.md` local "until their study is published" — the results are now
public on OSF/Zenodo but the paper awaits formal PCI RR recommendation; decide whether the
doc returns to the public repo now or after recommendation.

## 2026-07-02/03 — decision review session (full D-01…D-22 re-validation with Claude Code)

All decisions re-examined with rationale ahead of Phase A implementation. The architecture
stands; the one change is the dashboard frontend (below). Micro-decisions confirmed along
the way: published time bucket = ISO week (Mon–Sun), daily granularity stays internal;
conversation-count views carry a footnote that the credit UI nudges chat fragmentation
(D-08); corpus label tables will record per-row provenance (`human_consensus` vs `gpt5`)
for the `bergmann-v1` import; classifier policy is quality-first on the consented Azure
OpenAI EU platform (`open-questions.md`).

**D-16 flag resolved: `bergmann-framework.md` stays local.** Reviewed against the public
Stage-2 release: restoring the doc to the public repo gains nothing concrete (no Phase A
dependency), so it remains local-only until the team's paper is formally
recommended/published — D-16's original wording already covers this; no amendment needed.

**D-23 · Dashboard frontend = Next.js (static export), mirroring agent-ui.** (Amends D-11;
touches D-13.) D-11's frontend rationale ("Angular daily") is stale — development is now
agent-driven rather than hand-fluent, which changes the optimization target. What survives
of D-11 is pattern reuse, and for the frontend that now points at
`~/Developer/uni-studAsst-projects/ai_agents_ws/agent-ui` (Next.js 15 + React + Tailwind +
Radix, a working deployed example) exactly as health-research-agent-api anchors the API
tier. Drivers: agentic-coding fluency (React's training-data density, post-hooks idiom
stability vs Angular's recent API churn, single-file component locality), the owned
reference implementation, and the richer React charting ecosystem. Static export
(`output: 'export'`) keeps the deployment shape a plain static bundle — no Node server.
Backend (FastAPI), deploy pattern, and the D-18 auth boundary are unchanged; D-13
(English-only) unchanged, future German via next-intl instead of Angular i18n. Accepted
cost: framework split vs StatsBot's Angular — fine because the repos share data, not code
(D-01).

## 2026-07-05 — aggregates-contract design session (D-19 gate, with Claude Code)

**D-24 · Working privacy floor lowered to N = 3.** (Amends D-09's working value; the rule
and its local application point are unchanged.) Project-owner call during the
aggregates-contract brainstorm: at the current cohort scale (~182 users in the Bergmann
window), N = 5 suppresses a large share of fine-grained cells — the hour×weekday heatmap
especially. k = 3 is the recognized lower bound in statistical-disclosure-control practice
(k = 5 the conservative default). The published file declares `privacy_floor_n` in its
metadata, so no reader hardcodes the value: if the ethics confirmation (go-live gate,
`open-questions.md`, unchanged) later forces 5, that is a pipeline config change plus
republish, not a schema change. Slightly widens the accepted repeated-releases residual
risk (`ethics/data-handling.md`), same reasoning applies.

Sequencing note (recorded in the Phase A plan): local real-data ingest and validation are
pulled forward — the go-live gates bind the first cloud publish, not local development.
The public demo switches from synthetic to real aggregates as soon as the three gates
(pepper custody, floor confirmation, architecture nod) close; synthetic fixtures remain
the permanent basis for tests/CI, and every published file self-labels via a
`data_provenance` metadata field.

**D-25 · Aggregates contract v1 locked.** (Closes the D-19 contract gate; honors the
2026-07-02/03 pinned inputs.) Full spec: `docs/aggregates-contract.md`. Key choices:
explicit tagged cells (`ok`/`suppressed` discriminated union; suppressed cells carry no
value field — sub-floor numbers structurally cannot leak); the floor always tests distinct
contributing students, never value magnitude; complete ISO weeks only; the client never
re-aggregates — every displayed (metric × window) is its own pre-aggregated floored cell,
so the viewable windows are part of the contract (one registry: semesters by the
Thursday-membership rule, `all_time`, `trailing_4`); footnotes as a referenced registry;
`label_versions` as a domain→version map (pluralizes the pinned `label_version`; D-07's
one-active-version-per-domain made structural); metadata additions `timezone` and
`data_provenance`; blob protocol = immutable versioned blobs + atomically overwritten
full-copy `latest.json` under a major-version prefix (`v1/`); additive-only evolution
within a major. Phase B extends the same file (new `topics` section +
`label_versions.classification`).
